## 🧪 Cybersecurity Labs & Projects

I believe in **learning by doing**. Below are some of my hands-on labs and mini-projects designed to simulate real-world security work:

### 🔧 Azure Honeypot Attack Map (Azure · Sentinel · KQL)

- Deployed a honeypot in Azure and integrated with Microsoft Sentinel for real-time monitoring.
- Tracked 17.2k+ login attempts globally using enriched logs and visualized data using KQL queries.
- Mapped attack sources and behaviors through custom dashboards and geo-location heatmaps.

### 🔐 Active Directory Infrastructure Lab (Windows Server · GPO · Splunk · VirtualBox)

- Set up a multi-VM AD lab environment with DHCP, NAT, and DNS roles on Windows Server.
- Promoted the domain controller and joined client machines to the domain (adlab.local).
- Deployed GPOs, installed and configured Splunk for centralized log monitoring.
- Automated creation of 1000+ users via PowerShell.

### 🛡️ File Integrity Monitoring (Windows · PowerShell · SHA512)

- Created a PowerShell-based script to monitor file changes in real time.
- Generated baseline file hashes using SHA-512 and compared against current values.
- Detected unauthorized file creations, modifications, and deletions with console alerts.
