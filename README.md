## 🧪 Cybersecurity Labs & Projects

I believe in **learning by doing**. Below are some of my hands-on labs and mini-projects designed to simulate real-world security work:

### 🔧 Azure Honeypot Attack Map (Azure · Sentinel · KQL)

 Project Highlights:

- Deployed a virtual honeypot on Microsoft Azure to simulate real-world cyberattacks.
- Integrated the honeypot with Azure Sentinel for advanced threat detection and monitoring.
- Utilized Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze security logs and extract meaningful attack patterns.
- Enriched logs with GeoIP data to pinpoint the geographic origin of threats.
- Designed an interactive Attack Map Workbook to visualize failed login attempts globally.
- Gained hands-on experience in cloud security, SIEM integration, and log-based investigation.

# 🏢 Active Directory Lab for Threat Simulation and Detection

**🔑 Project Highlights:**

- 🖥️ Setup Active Directory Domain**: Deployed **Windows Server** as Domain Controller with **DNS** and **AD services**.
- 🔌 Integrated Sysmon & Splunk**: Collected endpoint logs via **Sysmon** and forwarded them to **Splunk** for centralized analysis.
- 💻 Simulated Real-World Attacks**: Performed attacks like **Kerberoasting**, **Pass-the-Hash**, and **DCSync** using **Kali Linux**.
- 🔍 Log Analysis & Detection**: Developed **detection queries** in **Splunk** to identify malicious activity and lateral movement.
- 🛡️ Hands-on AD Security**: Gained practical experience in **Active Directory management**, **log aggregation**, and **security detection**.
